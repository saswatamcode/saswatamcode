I'm an Associate SWE at Red Hat as part of the OpenShift monitoring (RHOBS) team, where I work on monitoring-related technologies for building and running observability platforms on Kubernetes/OpenShift. Previously, was an intern on the same team at Red Hat after successfully completing GSoC'21 as a mentee under the [Thanos](https://thanos.io/) project.

Currently, maintaining several open-source projects like [Thanos](https://thanos.io/tip/thanos/maintainers.md/) which is a [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/) incubating project for distributed monitoring, and [Observatorium](https://observatorium.io/docs/community/maintainers.md/) which is a meta-project to construct several open-source observability projects into a distributed observability platform. Also, help maintain other tools & libraries within the community such as [mdox](https://github.com/bwplotka/mdox) & [efficientgo/e2e](https://github.com/efficientgo/e2e), and mentor for [Thanos LFX](https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/mentor/4bae0944-b520-4b17-ae27-910894932998) projects from time to time! ðŸŒ±

Interested in all things related to Observability, K8s, SRE, Distributed Systems, and Golang.

Feel free to reach out to me via email, CNCF slack, twitter, or linkedin as linked above! ðŸ™‚
